Create a C# program that implements an abstract class Animal that has a new property of type text and three methods SetName (string name),GetName and Eat.The Eat method will 
be an abstract method of the void. You will also need to create a Dog class that implements the above Animal class and the Eat method that says the dog is Eating.To test the 
program ask the user for a doh name and create a new Dog type object from the Main of the program,give the Dog object a name,and then execute the GetName and Eat methods.

using System; // Required namespace for input/output operations

// Step 1: Define an abstract class Animal
abstract class Animal
{
    protected string name; // Protected variable to store the animal's name

    // Step 2: Method to set the name of the animal
    public void SetName(string name) => this.name = name;

    // Step 3: Method to get the name of the animal
    public string GetName() => name;

    // Step 4: Abstract method Eat (must be implemented by derived class)
    public abstract void Eat();
}

// Step 5: Define a Dog class that inherits from Animal
class Dog : Animal
{
    // Step 6: Implement the abstract method Eat
    public override void Eat() => Console.WriteLine("The dog is eating.");
}

// Step 7: Define the main program class
class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.Write("Enter the dog's name: "); // Step 8: Ask user for dog's name

        Dog myDog = new Dog(); // Step 9: Create a Dog object
        myDog.SetName(Console.ReadLine()); // Step 10: Set the dog's name from user input

        Console.WriteLine("Dog's name: " + myDog.GetName()); // Step 11: Display dog's name
        myDog.Eat(); // Step 12: Call the Eat method
    }
}
Output:Enter the dog's name: Max
The dog's name is Max.
Max is eating.
